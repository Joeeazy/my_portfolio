          I'm a freelance Full Stack Web Developer. Here's my story: My journey
          began in the world of public health, where I envisioned a career
          shaping community well-being. However, life had a twist waiting for
          me. As I sat in my lectures, my mind wandered on What my peers were
          learning in other fields. Software engineering caught my eye. Without
          a roadmap, I dove into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I later joined ALX
          AFRICA, where I've grown to become a full-stack software developer.
